To run the code, clone the repository, download the data from the Dropbox so
the data is in the same folder

```
some_directory/
    RI Hospital ELVO DATA/...
    Example Scan.ipynb
    untitled.py
```
 
Then run the following commands while
in the root directory of the repo.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 untitled.py
```

The Jupyter notebook contains some code which shows a slice of a scan on the
browser.

## TODO

* Connect the data labels to the images
* Build and run a simple ConvNet on the data
* Write better instructions for how to use the code
* Make sure that the code runs on Python 2
* Make sure that the data is anonymized.
