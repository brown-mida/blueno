To run the code, clone the repository, download the data from the Dropbox so
the data is in the same folder

```
some_directory/
    RI Hospital ELVO DATA/...
    Example Scan.ipynb
    untitled.py
```
 
Then run the following commands while
in the root directory of the repo.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

The Jupyter notebooks contains some code for generating images of
the data which can be interactively run in the browser.

Type in `jupyter notebook` into the console to start the notebook.


## TODO

* Write test cases focused on ensuring that all preprocessing steps are completed
* Write initial test cases to ensure that models are training correctly
* Write better instructions for how to get started with the code
* Create a contribution guide
* Make sure that the data is anonymized.
